## Project Aim 
This project aims to generate a report consisting of 5 visualisations (1 Heat map, 2 bar plots and 2 box plots). User can select an element of interest, correlation type and correlation threshold to filter for. Streamlit was used to code the user interface. 

## How to run it on local machine
1. Clone github repository 
2. Install Streamlit: Start by installing Streamlit on your local machine. You can use pip (Python's package installer) to install it by running the following command in your terminal: pip install streamlit 
3. Run the Streamlit application: To run your application, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Correlation.py file is located, and use the following command: streamlit run Correlation.py 
4. Iterate and update your application: As you make changes to your Correlation.py file, you can save it and see the changes automatically reflected in the browser. Streamlit provides hot reloading, so you don't need to restart the server manually.
